# Seoggi Programming Language

A modern systems programming language designed for performance, safety, and simplicity.

## Core Design Philosophy
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- First-class concurrency support
- Built-in security primitives
- Direct hardware access capabilities

## Key Features

### Memory Management
- Compile-time memory safety
- No runtime garbage collection
- Deterministic resource handling
- Zero-cost abstractions

### Concurrency
- Async/await primitives
- Channel-based communication
- Lock-free data structures
- Thread safety guarantees

### Performance
- Direct hardware access
- SIMD optimization support
- Zero-cost error handling
- Efficient binary sizes
