# Seoggi Language Architecture

## Core Philosophy
Seoggi is designed to be a universal systems programming language that can handle everything from low-level kernel development to high-level GUI applications, without compromising on performance or safety.

## Language Features

### 1. Memory Model
- Zero-cost memory management with compile-time ownership tracking
- Optional garbage collection for high-level applications
- Direct memory manipulation for systems programming
- Hardware memory model awareness for different architectures

### 2. Type System
- Strong static typing with type inference
- Algebraic data types
- Dependent types for compile-time guarantees
- Effect system for tracking side effects
- Linear types for resource management

### 3. Concurrency Model
- Async/await built into the language core
- Channel-based message passing
- Shared memory with compile-time race detection
- Hardware-aware parallelism primitives
- Zero-cost green threads

### 4. Compilation Pipeline

Instead of traditional AST-based compilation, Seoggi uses a direct token stream processing approach:

1. Lexical Analysis
   - Direct token stream generation
   - Immediate pattern matching
   - Context-aware tokenization

2. Semantic Analysis
   - Direct IR generation from token stream
   - Parallel processing of independent code blocks
   - Immediate type checking and validation

3. Code Generation
   - Target-specific optimization
   - Direct machine code generation
   - LLVM-free backend for complete control

### 5. Meta-programming
- Compile-time code execution
- Powerful macro system without AST manipulation
- Direct code generation primitives
- Template metaprogramming with constraints

### 6. Platform Integration
- Native OS API integration
- Direct hardware access capabilities
- Cross-platform abstractions
- Foreign function interface without overhead

## Code Examples

```seoggi
// Low-level kernel module
kernel module VirtualMemory {
    unsafe fn map_page(virtual: *VirtualAddress, physical: *PhysicalAddress) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Direct hardware manipulation
        hardware::mmu::with_tables(|tables| {
            tables.map(virtual, physical, PageFlags::READABLE | PageFlags::WRITABLE)
        })
    }
}

// High-level AI system
ai module NeuralNetwork {
    // Type-safe tensor operations
    fn forward<T: Numeric>(input: Tensor<T>) -> Tensor<T> {
        // Hardware-accelerated computation
        @parallel for layer in self.layers {
            input = layer.activate(input)
        }
        input
    }
}

// GUI application
ui module MainWindow {
    // Reactive UI with compile-time checks
    view main() {
        Container {
            @bind state = use_state(0)
            
            Button {
                onClick: || state += 1
                text: "Count: {state}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Goals
- Zero overhead abstraction
- Predictable performance
- Direct hardware utilization
- Compile-time optimization
- Runtime performance matching or exceeding C/C++
